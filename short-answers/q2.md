Watch [this video on nodes and elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhvec8cXLlo)

What is the difference between an HTMLCollections and NodeLists? Are they arrays?

# Answer

A HTMLCollection is a collection of specified elements. Elements meaning tags such as span, header, and div. A NodeList is a collection of nodes. Nodes include elements but also include comments, attributes, and text within an element tag. They are both structured similar to arrays using the square brackets and can be accessed using the index but they are not arrays themselves.
