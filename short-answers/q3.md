# Question

What's the difference between `.innerText` and `.textContent`?

# Answer

The .textContent property returns the text how it was presented in the markup of out html. For example it will include whitespace such as tabs. .innerText property returns the text how it is presented on the page/website. If the text has a style that makes itt so it is not displayed on the page, then we won't get the text when we call the .innerText property.
